    "# Finite Field Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, a *finite field* is defined as a finite set of numbers and two operations + (addition) and *•* (multiplication) that satisfy the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. If *a* and *b* are in the set, *a + b* and *a • b* are in the set. We call this property *closed*.\n",
    "2. 0 exists and has the property *a + 0 = a*. We call this the *additive identity*.\n",
    "3. 1 exists and has the property *a • 1 = a*. We call this the *multiplicative identity*.\n",
    "4. If *a* is in the set, *-a* is in the set, which is defined as the value that makes *a + (-a) = 0*. This is what we call the *additive inverse*.\n",
    "5. If *a* is in the set and is not 0, *a<sup>-1</sup>* is in the set, which is defined as the value that makes *a • a<sup>-1</sup> = 1*. This is what we call the *multiplicative inverse*."
